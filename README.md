## Description

Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. As a Data Analyst, you'll work closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect.
